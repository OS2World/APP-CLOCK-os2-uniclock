Universal Clock & WTDPanel
==========================

This is a multi-timezone 'world clock' control and application for OS/2.  

The implementation is based around a special PM window class, 'WTDPanel', which
represents a single clock with a timezone, description, and various configuration
and styling options. The application, called 'Universal Clock', allows multiple
WTDPanels to be shown and managed.  The WTDPanel class, however, could easily be
taken for use in other applications or widgets.

Other planned (but not yet implemented) features include sunrise/sunset display, 
and possibly local weather reports.
